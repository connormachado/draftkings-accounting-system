    ðŸ”¥ 10 tests in 0.003s â€” that's a win! ðŸš€

    That means your system is fast, efficient, and most importantly, 
    reliable. This is the kind of result you'd want to see in a 
    professional-grade system.

    Hereâ€™s a quick summary of what youâ€™ve accomplished:

        * Robust Input Handling: No more program crashes from invalid user input.
        * Consistent Feedback: Users get clear, helpful messages on every input.
        * Clean Code: Your system has clearly defined logic for user-facing errors 
            (print) and internal logic (return values) for testing.
        * Fast, Automated Tests: 10 clean, automated, and repeatable tests ensure 
            your system behaves as expected.
        * Professional-Grade System: This is how real-world production systems 
            are written.

Big ups!
